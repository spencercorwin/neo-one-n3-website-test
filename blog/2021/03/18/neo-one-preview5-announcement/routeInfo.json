For this release we have targeted Preview5, the latest stable release of the [N3](https://medium.com/neo-smart-economy/introducing-neo-n3-the-next-evolution-of-the-neo-blockchain-b2960c4def6e) protocol currently under development. This release focuses on our node implementation as we are still working on getting our client and compiler packages up-to-date with the latest N3 releases.\n\nThere is currently a NEO•ONE Preview5 node deployed at https://staging.neotracker.io/rpc.\n\nTo build and run the node from source follow the documentation [here](/docs/node-source).\n\nTo get started with NEO•ONE you can install our node executable package from NPM with `yarn add @neo-one/node-bin@alpha` or `yarn add @neo-one/node-bin@3.1.1-preview5`. To run it run `npx neo-one-node --config <path/to/config.json>` where `<path/to/config>` is the full path to a valid node config file. For more information on node configuration see [here](/docs/node-configuration).\n\n### Further Work\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do to get NEO•ONE ready for N3. We are now working on getting our node, client, and compiler packages up-to-date with the latest N3 TestNet release.\n\n## Future\n\nLook out for the upcoming releases that will include node, client, and compiler compatibility with N3 TestNet.\n\nQuestions or concerns? Feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neo_one_suite)\n"},"date":"2021-03-18","link":"packages/neo-one-website/blog/2021-03-18-neo-one-preview5-announcement.md","author":{"name":"The NEO•ONE Team","twitter":"https://twitter.com/neo_one_suite"},"sidebar":[{"title":"RECENT POSTS","subsections":[{"title":"NEO•ONE Preview5 Announcement","slug":"/blog/2021/03/18/neo-one-preview5-announcement"},{"title":"NEO•ONE 2.7 Announcement","slug":"/blog/2020/07/23/neo-one-2-7-announcement"},{"title":"NEO•ONE 2.0 Announcement","slug":"/blog/2019/10/23/neo-one-2-announcement"},{"title":"Introducing NEO•ONE","slug":"/blog/2018/11/14/introducing-neo-one"},{"title":"All posts ...","slug":"/blog/all"}]}]},"path":"blog/2021/03/18/neo-one-preview5-announcement"}
